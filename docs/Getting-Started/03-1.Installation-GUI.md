# Composable Installation Wizard

The Composable installation wizard will provide the following steps:

1. Check system and software requirements.
    - The installer will check system requirements, space availability and automatically download and install any required software, such as a back-end database store. Specifically, SQL Server Express will be downloaded and installed as a back-end database if required. Composable will leverage the full-text indexer if you install SQL Server with advanced services.

8. **Server Settings**
    - Set the base path of the IIS web site. For a single / local machine http://localhost is fine. If on a corporate network, and you have a http proxy, set it here. An SMTP Server is also required to manage account registrations (e.g., e-mail registration confirmations and notifications).
